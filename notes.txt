There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

To figure out whodunit, go to the "mystery" sub-directory and start working from there.

You'll want to start by collecting all the clues at the crime scene (the "crimescene" file).

The officers on the scene are pretty meticulous, so they've written down EVERYTHING in their officer reports.

Fortunately the sergeant went through and marked the real clues with the word "CLUE" in all caps.

If you get stuck, open one of the hint files (from the Command Line, type "cat hint1", "cat hint2", etc.).

For tips on getting started with the Command Line, open "cheatsheet.md".

Don't use a text editor to view any files except "readme.md" and "cheatsheet.md".

Sarahs-MacBook-Pro:mystery sarah$ grep "CLUE" crimescene
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

To go to the street someone lives on, use the file
for that street name in the 'streets' subdirectory.
To knock on their door and investigate, read the line number
they live on from the file.  If a line looks like gibberish, you're at the wrong house.
